# Companion_Crutch
Code to control the data acquisition, sensory fusion and visualisation of the instrumentation of a sensorised crutch for rehabilitation, gate analysis, and exoskeleton control.

Project completed as Final Year Thesis for the M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London, 2015.

*Abstract*

Design, development and testing of a wireless instrumented crutch, with the aim to produce a non-invasive, cheap, and portable tool to assist patients and therapists in rehabilitation, monitoring, and gait analysis. There is currently no quantitative and non-invasive way to continuously monitor gait and lower-limb weight bearing of a crutch user outside of a clinical environment. Sensorised crutches represent an ideal solution to assess rehabilitation activity, perform gait analysis, and monitor injury or disease progression. Moreover, they can prove a useful addition to the control system of powered exoskeletons for paraplegic patients.

In this project, a forearm crutch was instrumented with a set of micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) sensors and interfaced with an Arduino board. Indicative measurements of tilt, axial load, and handle grip are transmitted wirelessly and stored locally on a micro-SD card. Data can then be visualised simultaneously on a computer, or retrieved at a later time. Furthermore, real-time biofeedback is provided to the user through visual and auditory signals to inform about incorrect usage. 
The results highlight the ability of the device to monitor gait, to help the user walk correctly, and to record useful data for a variety of applications. A successful proof of concept is thus provided, showing the numerous potential clinical benefits of the instrumented crutch over state-of-the-art technology.
